    """
    Applies overlapping max pooling to a 4D tensor (N, C, H, W).
    Uses ceil mode for output dimensions (allows partial windows at boundaries).

    Args:
        x: Input array of shape (N, C, H, W)
        kernel_size: Size of pooling window (int)
        stride: Stride between pooling windows (int), must be < kernel_size
